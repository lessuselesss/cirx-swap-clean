# Project State Summary (as of 2025-07-28)

This document provides a high-level summary of the current state of the Uniswap V3 Clone project, based on an analysis of the repository's file structure and code.

## Overall Status

The project is in a relatively advanced stage of development. The core smart contract logic and the frontend user interface are largely complete. The project is well-structured, with clear separation between the backend (Solidity/Foundry) and frontend (Nuxt.js/Vue.js) code. Automated testing and code quality measures are in place, which is a good sign of a mature development process.

## Feature Implementation Checklist

Here is a summary of the features requested in the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and their current implementation status:

| Feature | Status | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Wallet Integration** | 游릭 **Completed** | The project uses `wagmi` and `@wagmi/core` for wallet connections, supporting MetaMask and WalletConnect. |
| **OTC Purchase UI** | 游릭 **Completed** | The `ui/pages/swap.vue` file contains a well-structured and functional UI for OTC purchases. |
| **Token Selection** | 游릭 **Completed** | The UI allows users to select from a list of supported tokens (ETH, USDC, USDT, SOL). |
| **Real-time Price Quoting** | 游리 **Partially Implemented** | The UI displays a price, but it's based on mock data. It needs to be connected to a real-time price feed. |
| **Transaction Summary** | 游릭 **Completed** | The UI shows a summary of the transaction, including the exchange rate and fees, before confirmation. |
| **Transaction Status** | 游리 **Partially Implemented** | The UI shows loading states and success/failure messages, but a dedicated transaction history page is missing. |
| **Transaction History** | 游댮 **Not Implemented** | The "History" link in the UI is a placeholder and does not lead to a functional page. |
| **Responsive Design** | 游릭 **Completed** | The use of Tailwind CSS ensures the application is responsive across different devices. |
| **Charting Feature** | 游릭 **Completed** | The `lightweight-charts` library is integrated to display a price chart. |
| **Vesting Information** | 游릭 **Completed** | The UI clearly indicates the 6-month vesting period for OTC purchases. |
| **Discount Tiers** | 游릭 **Completed** | The UI displays the different discount tiers for OTC purchases. |

## Next Steps & Recommendations

1.  **Integrate a Price Oracle:** The most critical next step is to replace the mock price data with a real-time price feed from a reliable on-chain source (e.g., Chainlink, a Uniswap pool, etc.).
2.  **Implement Transaction History:** The `/history` page needs to be created to allow users to view their past transactions.
3.  **Frontend Testing:** While the smart contracts have tests, the frontend would benefit from its own suite of tests to ensure the UI is robust and bug-free.

Overall, the project is on a strong trajectory. The remaining work is well-defined and achievable.
